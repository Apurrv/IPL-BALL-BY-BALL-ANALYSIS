Our plan is to incorporate different big data tools like Spark/Hadoop and move forward with machine learning and Deep learning techniques as it forms the base of our big-data analytics.The project is a tool that facilitates the bond between a player and his cricketing skills as it leads to better understanding of the game. The main goal of the project is to improve players' game and style for an enhanced match-day performance and personal growth as an athlete. Coach standpoint is to squeeze the best performance out of the player for their franchises. Fans stand-point is to get more knowledge on their favourite teams' players. Commentators' standpoint is to know give the players' prediction of their own and make people get excited. And the list of applications goes further on and on.
